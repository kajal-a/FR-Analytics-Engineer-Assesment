Submission for Fetch Rewards Take Home Assessment 

This repository demonstrates the design and implementation of a dimensional model for a data warehouse. A description for each file included in the repository is given below:

1. RelationalDataModel.pdf: This document contains the diagram for the data model and explanations related to the schema. The diagram was created using an online diagramming 		 tool called LucidChart.
2. TakeHomeAssessment.ipynb Jupyter Notebook: This notebook focuses on part 2 and 3 of the exercise. I used Python and its built-in libraries for parsing JSON and 					    	 processing the dataframes and SQLite as the SQL Dialect for running the queries. I also evaluated the data for quality issues and found 2 main problems, the dataset has many 		null values, and secondly, almost half the records in the user's file are duplicated. links for downloading and installing jupyter notebook and SQLite are given below along 		with references.
4. rewards_db.db: A database file containing relational tables.
5. stakeholder_email.pdf: A brief summary of my findings articulated in an e-mail message.
